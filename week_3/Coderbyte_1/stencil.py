3. Use binary search to find the index of a list that a certain number exists at. 
Return -1 if number does not exist. Assume that the list is sorted.

4. Use binary search to find the index of a list that is the biggest number less than or equal to the given value. 
Return -1 if such a number does not exist. Assume that the list is sorted.
